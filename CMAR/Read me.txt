At first We used Weka to Split data into train and test set using RemovePercentage which is located in
package weka.filters.unsupervised.instance and 85% split. Then using invert selection feature I made a
test set for our data.
Then I loaded the training data set to create association rules using Asociate tab in Weka and fp-growth
algorithm and 35 rules to be generated which then I usded log to save it in <<rule>> file.
Then I used subset python function to find more general rule rather specific rules to delete them as redundant.
after this I had no time so I just tell you what I am gonna do probably: We then compute chi square and use a
threshold to remove some other data. Lastly, we use support to find coverage of our rules and use it to remove
low coverage rules.
Now that we have all of the rules that we need we use it to objectively classify data and find the accuracy of
data for test set.
